**Captcha Object Detection** is a dataset for an object detection task. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the optical character recognition (OCR) domain and security industry. 

The dataset consists of 100000 images with 650000 labeled objects belonging to 54 different classes including *V*, *n*, *8*, and other: *M*, *d*, *Y*, *R*, *6*, *C*, *f*, *s*, *a*, *J*, *y*, *2*, *t*, *Q*, *G*, *K*, *E*, *g*, *k*, *c*, *z*, *9*, *p*, *P*, *S*, and 26 more.

Images in the Captcha Object Detection dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2021.
